# 📒 RUNNING LOG (Production Phase)

This document is the **single source of truth** for production-phase execution in this repository.  
It records **what was done, what was observed, and what was decided** in a **layout-first HV IC exploration**.

- ❌ This is **NOT** a design specification.
- 📓 This is a **decision + result ledger** to make progress reproducible.

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Log (Operating Rules)

1. 🧾 Every significant action must be logged as a **Run** (Run ID increments).
2. ⚠ A Run is valid even if it fails (e.g., **DRC FAIL**). Failure is still a result.
3. 🔒 Do not overwrite history. When plans change, create a **new Run** or add a **Revision Note**.
4. ⚡ Use **V–I notation** consistently for electrical discussion (Voltage–Current).

## 🎯 Scope and Intent

- 🎛 **Target object:** HV_SW_UNIT  
- 🧬 **Process:** GF180MCU Open PDK  
- 🧱 **Focus:** Layout-first, GDS-oriented  
- 🏗 **Priority:** Physical robustness / arrayability > performance optimization  

### 🚫 Explicitly Out of Scope
- Circuit-level performance optimization  
- Tape-out readiness  
- Reliability qualification  
- Commercial usability / warranty  

---

## 🌍 Global Objectives

- 🧱 Establish a **physically valid HV_SW_UNIT layout**
- 🔍 Identify **layout-driven constraints** invisible at schematic level
- 📚 Accumulate reusable layout patterns and check items for future iterations

> ℹ Note: Formal DRC closure under GF180 is **not a requirement** in this phase due to the  
> absence of an official KLayout DRC deck in the current environment.

## 🧪 Run 001

### 🆔 Identification
- **Run ID:** 001  
- **Date:** 2026-01-12  
- **Tool:** KLayout 0.30.x (Windows)

### 🔍 Key Result
- P+ guard ring **dominates cell footprint**
- Naive tiling is impossible

### 🧠 Conclusion
- **Arrayable (X):** ❌ No  
- **Next:** Guard strategy isolation → **Run 002**

---

## 🧪 Run 002

### 🔍 Key Result
- Shared outer guard **removes guard-dominated pitch inflation**

### 🧠 Conclusion
- **Arrayable (X):** ⚠ Potentially yes  
- **Next:** Poly gate end isolation → **Run 003**

---

## 🧪 Run 003

### 🔍 Key Result
- Poly gate over-extension trimmed
- No new boundary artifacts introduced

### 🧠 Conclusion
- Poly is **not conclusively dominant**
- **Next:** Tiling-based pitch measurement → **Run 004**

---

## 🧪 Run 004

### 🧱 Layout Conditions
- **Base cell:** HV_SW_UNIT_RUN003  
- **Tiling direction:** X  
- **Tiles:** N = 5  
- **Tested pitch:** **16 µm**

### 👀 Observations
- 16 µm pitch is **geometrically feasible**
- Guard and poly no longer limit pitch
- ⚠ **Metal1 edge stub approaches spacing limit**

### 🧠 Conclusion
- **Arrayable (X) at 16 µm:** ✅ Yes (marginal)
- **Dominant pitch limiter:** **Metal1 stub**
- **Next:** Metal1-only single-knob experiment → **Run 005**

---

## 🧪 Run 005

### 🆔 1) Identification
- **Run ID:** 005  
- **Date:** 2026-01-12  
- **Tool:** KLayout 0.30.x (Windows)

---

### 🧱 2) Layout Conditions
- **Base cell:** HV_SW_UNIT_RUN003 (unchanged)  
- **Single knob:** Metal1 stub geometry only  
- **Array direction:** X  
- **Tiles:** N = 5  
- **Pitch sweep:** 16 µm → 14 µm → 12 µm  
- **Guard / Poly:** Frozen (from Run 003)

---

### 🔎 3) Verification Status
- **DRC / LVS:** NOT PERFORMED  
- **Method:** Visual inspection + ruler-based spacing confirmation

---

### 👀 4) Observations

#### ✅ 16 µm
- Fully clean margin
- No M1 proximity concern

#### ⚠ 14 µm
- M1 stub spacing reduced but **still acceptable**
- No overlap or edge-touch

#### ❗ 12 µm
- Geometry remains **non-overlapping**
- M1 stub becomes **clear dominant limiter**
- Spacing margin approaches practical minimum

---

### 🧠 5) Conclusions

- **Minimum safe pitch (manual):** **≈12–14 µm**
- **Final dominant constraint:** **Metal1 stub geometry**
- Guard ring and poly gate end are **fully de-risked**
- Pitch scaling below 12 µm would require:
  - 🛠 M1 topology redesign, or
  - 🧭 Vertical routing layer migration (e.g., M2)

## 🏁 Final Decision Summary

- **Pitch limiter progression:**  
  Guard → Poly → **Metal1**
- **HV_SW_UNIT is physically arrayable**
- **Layout-first objective achieved**

> ✅ This concludes the **HV_SW_UNIT pitch discovery phase**.  
> Any further run would be **architectural**, not exploratory.
