# 📘 Documentation – gf180-inkjet-driver

This directory contains **layout- and GDS-oriented design notes** for the  
**GF180-based inkjet printhead driver IC exploration**.

These documents focus on:

- 🧱 **Architecture definition**
- ⚡ **High-voltage device usage**
- 🧭 **Layout-driven mixed-signal design**

with the explicit goal of supporting **manual GDS generation** using the  
**GF180MCU Open PDK**.

Rather than serving as a complete IC specification, these materials function as:

- 📐 **Design rationale**
- 🧾 **Layout justification**
- 🧪 **Recorded architectural limits discovered at the GDS level**

Both *successful structures* and *explicitly failed approaches* are preserved,
grounded in **what was physically drawable and verifiable in GDS**.

## 🧱 Representative GDS Artifact

The image below shows a **representative HV switch unit GDS** generated during
this exploration.

It demonstrates:

- 🟩 DNWELL enclosure  
- 🔁 Continuous P+ guard ring  
- ⚡ Central HV device structure  
- 📍 Explicit D / G / S / B pin exposure

---

## 🧩 Array Layout Evolution — 400 dpi Study

The following snapshots document the **stepwise evolution** of the HV_SW_UNIT
array toward **400 dpi pitch (63.5 µm)**.

Each image captures a concrete layout decision and marks the point where a
design assumption was **validated or rejected** at the GDS level.

---

### 🔹 Independent Unit Isolation (Baseline)

![HV_SW_UNIT Array – Independent DNWELL and Guard Ring](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/gf180-inkjet-driver/docs/images/03_hv_unit_array_full_gds.png)

- DNWELL and guard ring isolated per unit  
- Guard ring outer boundary dominates pitch  
- ❌ **400 dpi clearly infeasible**

---

### 🔹 Column-wise Guard Ring Sharing

![HV_SW_UNIT Array – Column-wise Guard Ring Sharing](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/gf180-inkjet-driver/docs/images/04_hv_sw_unit_array_gr_shared_FIXED_gds.png)

- Guard ring redundancy reduced  
- Partial pitch relief achieved  
- Unit-level remnants still interfere  

---

### 🔹 Guard-Ring-Clean Shared Array (Final Check)

![HV_SW_UNIT Array – Guard Ring Clean Shared Configuration](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/gf180-inkjet-driver/docs/images/05_hv_sw_unit_array_gr_shared_clean_gds.png)

- Unit-level guard rings fully removed  
- Guard ring no longer dominant  
- ❌ DNWELL enclosure & spacing become decisive limiters

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This documentation prioritizes:

- 🧱 **Layout-first decision making**  
- 🔬 GDS-level understanding over schematic or RTL completeness  
- ✂ Minimal structures directly translatable into layout  
- 📝 Explicit recording of **why certain approaches fail**  

The goal is not a finished inkjet driver IC, but the preservation of  
**design reasoning grounded in physical layout reality**.

---

## 📊 Status

- ✅ Automated digital flow feasibility evaluated  
- ✅ Manual HV device & unit layout completed  
- ✅ Array & guard-ring sharing studies completed  
- ❌ 400 dpi (63.5 µm) feasibility: **structurally infeasible under GF180 DNWELL rules**

---

## 🧪 Why a 4×2 NMOS-Based Array Was Chosen

Before fixing 300 dpi as the baseline, a **4×2 NMOS-based HV switch array**
was selected as the **minimum feasibility checkpoint**.

Reasons:

- ⚠ **Worst-case isolation first**  
- 🎯 **Avoid edge-dominated artifacts**  
- 🔁 **Array-level repetition & sharing check**

Once **300 dpi** was confirmed under this worst-case condition,
it was promoted to the **baseline (golden) array**.

---

## ✅ 300 dpi Array — Final Outcome

A **300 dpi pitch (~85.0 µm)** was selected as the **minimum viable and
structurally consistent solution** under GF180MCU rules.

## 🔌 HV Inverter 1ch Unit (300 dpi) — WIP

A **1-channel HV CMOS inverter basic cell** intended for
**300 dpi inkjet driver arrays**.

> Status: **INCOMPLETE / UNDER DEFINITION**  
> This is a physically grounded baseline, not a tapeout-ready macro.

### Evidence (GDS)

![HV Inverter 1ch Layout](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/gf180-inkjet-driver/docs/images/15_hv_inv_1ch_260119.png)

**Figure — HV Inverter 1ch basic cell @300 dpi**  
This GDS snapshot is the **single source of truth** for the statements below.

### Fixed Rules
- **Cell center = VOUT trunk**
- Horizontal tiling at **300 dpi** without cumulative offset
- HV intent expressed by **gate offset + drain-side drift**, not cell shift

### Shown Layers (Conceptual)
dnwell / nwell / pwell / n+ / p+ / poly / contact / metal1 / bbox

### Known Missing (Intentional)
- Not DRC/LVS ready
- VIN routing undefined
- Guard ring & power strategy handled at top/array level

### Docs
- Unit: `docs/unit/hv_inv_1ch/README.md`
