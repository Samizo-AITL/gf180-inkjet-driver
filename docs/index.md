# Documentation – gf180-inkjet-driver

This directory contains technical notes and design explorations for the
**GF180-based inkjet printhead driver IC**.

The documents focus on **architecture**, **high-voltage device usage**,
and **layout-driven mixed-signal design**.

---

## Document Index

- **architecture.md**  
  Overall IC architecture and block partitioning

- **hv-devices.md**  
  High-voltage devices in GF180MCU and their usage considerations

- **driver-topology.md**  
  Inkjet driver stage concepts and minimal topologies

- **layout-notes.md**  
  Layout-focused notes, spacing, guard rings, and HV isolation

- **roadmap.md**  
  Exploration roadmap and future expansion ideas

---

## Design Philosophy

This documentation prioritizes:

- Layout-first thinking
- Minimal functional blocks
- Educational clarity over completeness
- Reusability as a reference for future designs

This is **not** a finalized IC specification.
