# Layout Notes and Observations

## Layout-First Approach

In inkjet driver ICs, **layout is the design**.

This document captures layout-centric observations rather than schematic theory.

---

## Key Topics

- HV spacing rules
- Guard ring placement
- Substrate noise awareness
- Digital-to-analog separation

---

## Early Observations

- HV devices dominate die area
- Guard rings are not optional
- Symmetry matters more than compactness

---

## To Be Explored

- Shared vs isolated substrate regions
- Power routing strategies
- DFM robustness
